# DITA Documentation on Cooking with Stainless Steel Pans

This repository contains XML files following DITA rules related to cooking with stainless steel pans. The content was created to address common challenges and provide guidance on stainless steel cookware. The idea for this documentation came after a week of burning my own food. 

Currently, this repository includes:
- [One Task topic](How-to-cook-with-Stainless-Steel-Pans.dita)
- [One Concept topic](WhyStainlessSteel.dita)
- [One Reference topic](StainlessSteelReference.dita)
- One Ditamap

Feel free to explore and contribute.
